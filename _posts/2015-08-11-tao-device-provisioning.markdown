The IP that can be leased is not eternal and must be renewed.  
The hostname that is assigned shall be updated on DNS.  
DHCP is the origin of provisioning, where networking begins.  
TFTP is the mother of configuration files, the root of bandwidth.  
Thus, constantly, without a break, devices come to life.  
CM says: DHCP and TFTP. MTA says: DHCP, SNMP and TFTP.  
The two emerge in a sequence but differ in provisioning flow  
and differ in DHCP options and configuration files.  
The unity is the mystery of CM's MAC address in option 82.  
Mystery of mysteries, MAC address, the key to all grep.
