Some time ago, a friend of mine claimed that he is able to transform "C" players into "A" players. But... is that possible?

The second best management book of all time, the Tarot, incarnates the perception of government in the figure of The Emperor. The Emperor, which is the Hebrew letter Dalet, is literally a man poor of spirit and as such, the government of mind over heart, the absolute domain of reason over emotions.

When government within modern organizations is perceived as purely rational and emotionless (they don't care about us!) a decrease in performance is inevitable. It will affect more or less people depending on their subjective and personal reality; but it will be worse when communication is poor.

People are hard to manage because they have a spirit and emotions. Good leaders are aware that human beings are conducted by their emotions; outstanding leaders focus their actions on that truth. Years ago, I had a mentor who was a master in the art of careful selection of words, an emotional Jedi. Sometimes, like the flap of a butterflyâ€™s wings in Brazil, small things can set off a tornado.

So... how did my friend to transform an apparent "C" player into an "A" player? He listened, he began to ask his opinion on various matters and finally, he gave him more responsibilities...
