A MOM or Message Oriented Middleware is a software platform for the exchange of messages between distributed systems. These platforms have been around for the last fifteen years but have gained popularity in recent times with the huge increase in the speed and amount of information and the explosive growth of cloud computing. Thus, it's becoming common to find elements such as message queues and asynchronous communication in the core of the design of modern software architectures.

These elements lead to the existence of a software layer that is inherently complex and requires proper engineering to meet non-functional business requirements like dependability, security and performance. This introduces the need for software engineers who understand the various challenges of distributed systems and are able to think in terms of protocols, messaging, synchronization, redundancy, latency, throughput and heterogeneity.

A fast-paced era where distributed systems are at the center of the scene? These are exciting times for Distributed Systems Engineers!
